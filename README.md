PURPLEAIR CALIBRATION - CODES AND DATA

DATA

(1) "r0_5km_processeddata_PA_AQS_Jan2021_Aug2023_Final.csv" and "DAILY90_r0_5km_processeddata_PA_AQS_Jan2021_Aug2023_Final.csv" are respectively the hourly and daily processed 
datasets used in the analyses to develop the calibration model of low-cost particulate matter sensors PurpleAir for air quality under high relative humidity conditions.

(2) "Hourly_Predicted_concentrations.csv" and "Daily_Predicted_concentrations.csv" represent respectively the hourly and daily predicted concentrations obtained after applying
the main models developed in the study of calibration of low-cost particulate matter sensors PurpleAir for air quality under high relative humidity conditions.
