Calibration of PurpleAir low-cost PM sensors - Code and datasets

This file describes codes and data used in the study on "Calibration of Low-Cost Particulate Matter Sensors PurpleAir: Model Development for Air Quality under High Relative Humidity Conditions"

Datasets

(1) "r0_5km_processeddata_PA_AQS_Jan2021_Aug2023_Final.csv" and "DAILY90_r0_5km_processeddata_PA_AQS_Jan2021_Aug2023_Final.csv" are respectively the hourly and daily processed datasets used in the analyses to develop the bias correction models. These data are used in the SSC and MLR modeling R code.

(2) "Hourly_Predicted_concentrations.csv" and "Daily_Predicted_concentrations.csv" are respectively the hourly and daily predicted concentrations obtained after applying the developed models.
